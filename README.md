##File Naming
File Names should be camelcased and, if necessary, platform should be separated with a hyphen.

####Good
```
paymentWidget.less
paymentWidget-mobile.less
```

####Bad
```
payment-widget.less
payment-widget-mobile.less
paymentWidgetMobile.less
```

##Selectors
Element tags `(p, h1, blockquote, ul)` should only be targeted if the applied style will affect all of those tags or is generated by the CMS. As a rule, we should add a class name when overwriting default styles.

####Good####
```less
ul {
  margin: 0;
}

.payment-form {
  .payment-list {
  	margin: 10px;
  }
}
```
  
```html
<div class="payment-form">
  <ul class="payment-list">
	  <li class="payment-item">....</li>
	</ul>
</div>
```
####Bad
```less
ul {
  margin: 0;
}

.payment-form {
  ul {
  	margin: 0;
  	
  	li {
  	  padding: 0;
  	}
  }
}
```
  
```html
<div class="payment-form">
  <ul>
	  <li>....</li>
	</ul>
</div>
```

##Naming Conventions
Class Names should also be hyphenated and IDs should always be camelcased.
####Good
```less
#paymentWidget
.payment-widget
```

####Bad
```less
#payment-widget
.paymentWidget
```

##JS Prefixes
Classes used in javascript should be prefixed with `js-`, whether they be created dynamically or from page load. JS prefixed classes shouldn't be referenced in LESS so we can separate JavaScript hooks and LESS hooks. If a JS prefixed class is added to the DOM dynamically it can be referenced in LESS files to avoid adding more classes than necessary; this is a common practice and makes updating code more efficient as removing a JS prefixed class should have no negative implications on styles and an unprefixed class should have no negative implications on JavaScript. 

###Good
```html
<div class="js-payment-widget payment-widget">
	...
</div>
```
```javascript
$('.js-payment-widget').addClass('js-active');
```

```less
.payment-widget {
	float: left;
}

.js-active {
	display: block;
}
```

###Bad
```html
<div class="js-payment-widget">
	<div class="payment-group">
		...
	</div>
</div>
```
```javascript
$('.payment-group').addClass('active');
```

```less
.js-payment-widget {
	float: left;
}

.active {
	display: block;
}
```


##Use of IDs
IDs should not be used in LESS as they are too specific and rigid; IDs should be reserved for Javascript use only. Classes can do everything IDs can do and can be used multiple times on a page, although IDs are slightly faster in terms of performance, they are not fast enough to be beneficial and are actually worse for performance than a class when used to namespace elements. [[1]](http://oli.jp/2011/ids/) Using an ID can also provide issues later on by creating overly specific code.

##Specificity
Selectors should be nested a maximum of 4 levels deep. If two selectors are applied to the same element, the one with the highest specificity will win, regardless of itâ€™s position in the stylesheet; because of this we should only be specific when absolutely necessary in order to avoid writing messy and unnecessary code; this is another reason why we do not use IDs in LESS, as they have a higher specificty rating.

##Mixins

###Mixin Presentation
Mixins should be declared at the top of the rulset and the final mixin should have a break line before the first css property is declared.

####Good
```less 
.icon {
	.animation(spin 0.5s linear);
	.transition(0.3s all linear);

	position: absolute;
}
```

####Bad
```less
.icon {
	.animation(spin 0.5s linear);
	position: absolute;
	.transition(0.3s all linear);
}
```

###Mixin Use
Mixins should only use one argument and, if necessary, comma separated values can be passed through by escaping the mixin with a semi-colon before the closing bracket.

####Good
```less
.fade {
	.transition(0.3s all linear);
}

.fade-scale {
	.transition(0.3s opacity linear, 0.3s transform linear;);
}
```

####Bad
```less
.fade {
	.transition(0.3s, all, linear);
}
```
